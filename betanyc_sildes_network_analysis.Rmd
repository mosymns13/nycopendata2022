## Why Network Analysis?

.pull-left[

- Recently attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed educational programming retreat, where I worked on various fun programming projects
- As an anthropologist with a keen interest in how social change happens, network analysis had long been an area that I wanted to explore
- Potential for network analysis to be leveraged in future DEIB work

## What is Network Analysis?

--

#### Wikipedia defines it as
> the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory.


--
#### Simply stated ... 

--
.my-green[
### You're looking at relationships between people (or organizations) and creating visuals to represent it
]

--
This is done with some 
- data, 
- little bit of statistics, 
- and graphing

## Let's go over some terms you will hear and see today
]

---

## R Terms 

.pull-left[

#### Libraries or Packages

```{r packages, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
```
- A place where functions are held that will be use in our code

#### RMarkdown (Rmd) [or Script]  
- A place where code is written and can execute (run)

### RStudio Cloud

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/rstudio-cloud.png")
```


.center[
```{r installing, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "igraph", "ggraph", "RSocrata", "networkD3"))
```
]
---

## Social Network Terms

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="60%" , fig.cap= "from Builtin Article"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/nodes_and_edges.png")
```
]

.pull-right[

### Nodes or Vertices (the dots)
- the people in your network


### Edges (the lines)
- the connections between people

## Social Network Terms

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="60%" }
knitr::include_graphics("photos/bookcover.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[

### Node Centrality

  - How connected the individual is to other influential individuals
  - Useful for discovering "superconnectors"


### Detect Communities

  - Highly connected clusters of individuals
  - Useful for understanding what factors most influence community formation and whether communities are heavily segregated

## Time to do a walkthrough! 
Follow along by coding alongside us or by running the Rmd in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/natalieoshea/nycopendata2022/blob/master/network-analysis.Rmd)!

## Network Analysis Inspiration

Look for data sets that records actions from people. 

Some examples include:
 - Reviews on products
 - Voting 
 - Social media connections 

For NYC Open Data: 

We created a data set collection using [Scout](https://scout.tsdataclinic.com/about) as a starting point for some inspriation to do your own network analysis.
