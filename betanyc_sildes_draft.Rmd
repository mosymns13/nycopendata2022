### Technical Set up

Fill in any details about making sure all systems are set (whether markdown or R script) and using the cloud.

---

### Tell a story

- Why are we doing this today?
- What are the questions or problems we are hoping to solve?

---

## What is a network analysis?

--

#### Wikipedia defines it as
> the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory.


--
#### Simply stating ... 

--
.my-green[
### You're looking at relationships between people (or organizations) and creating visuals to represent it
]

--
This is done with some 
- data, 
- little bit of statistics, 
- and graphing

## Let's go over some terms you will hear and see today
]

## Social Network Terms

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%" , fig.cap= "from Builtin Article"}
knitr::include_graphics("photos/nodes_and_edges.png")
```
]

.pull-right[

### Nodes (the dots)
> the people in your network


### Edges (the lines)
> the connections between people


### Centrality Measures (the stat)
> measures how important or influencial the node (person) in relation to the network

## R Terms 

.pull-left[

#### Libraries or Packages

```{r packages, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
```
> A place where functions are held that will be use in our code

#### RMarkdown (Rmd) [or Script]  
> A place where code is written and can execute (run)

--> OTHER NOTES TO REMOVE
- describe how R is our tool of choice for analysis 
- R community and subcommunites
- Describe tools being used

## Network Analysis Inspiration

Look for data sets that records actions from people. 

Some examples include:
 - Reviews on products
 - Voting 
 - Social media connections 

For NYC Open Data: 

We created a data set collection using [Scout](https://scout.tsdataclinic.com/about) as a starting point for some inspriation to do your own network analysis.
