# Network Analysis of NYC Campaign Finance Data using R
## March 6, 2022, at 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm

In this workshop, participants will be introduced to the basics of network analysis using the 2021 Campaign Contributions dataset on the NYC Open Data Portal. We will walk through how to load data into R directly from the portal using the `RSocrata` package, how to restructure these data for use in network graphs using data wrangling techniques from the `tidyverse`, and, finally, how to create network graphs and use network analysis to generate insights into campaign finance connections between different candidates running for office in New York City. Participants should leave this workshop feeling inspired and equipped to apply network analysis to all sorts of datasets available on NYC Open Data.
